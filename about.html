                <p>Sarah, an Associate, is a planner and landscape designer, specializing in urban design with a UX / UI twist. Sarah’s typical projects, driven by extensive public engagement, are focused on quality urban design, downtown planning, TOD, parks, trails, and equitable public policies. She works with communities to develop recommendations that reduce the equity gap caused by historic policy decisions, promote active and healthy living, and advance environmental sustainability. Years of administrative experience allow her to effectively coordinate complex projects and budgets with many competing interests. Throughout the planning process, she focuses on inclusive and interactive community engagement techniques to ensure that meaningful input informs design decisions. This allows her to deliver community-vetted and graphically-compelling plans with implementation results.

                <br><br>In 2019, she was a lecturer at the Georgia Institute of Technology’s Graduate School of City and Regional Planning, teaching a Visualization for Planning course. She also volunteers her design and analysis capabilities for initiatives at Noble Clay Fitness, a non-profit seeking to reduce Atlanta’s equity gap in fitness and health.
                
                <br><br>During her previous employment with AECOM, Sarah worked on multiple parks and recreation master plan projects and urban streetscape design projects. She also worked at the Atlanta Regional Commission and updated the region’s green space GIS inventory at the city and county levels, and she illustrated the PLAN 2040 Development Guide.
                
                <br><br>Since joining TSW, Sarah has worked on a variety of projects, including the 2020 Decatur Strategic Plan update; Sandy Springs North End Design; Make East Lake MARTA Yours (East Lake MARTA LCI Study); Sumter, SC Downtown Master Plan; MARTA Makeover (2015 GPA Outstanding Planning Process Award); Cultivate Lake City: Downtown Lake City Master Plan; the Gulf Shores Public Beach Master Plan; many LCI projects; and the Colonial Homes II Redevelopment.</p>

                <p>I practice the urbanism I preach by living car-free, walking, and taking transit. In my free time, I am an avid CrossFitter, enjoy painting and drawing, and love to get lost in books. </p>
